# Unity

## Contents
This is a repo consisting of little side projects I've put together. 

### /DesignPatterns
This is a folder full of individual projects that I put together, each on a specific Design Pattner that's applicable to Game Development.  All projects will run in Unity 2021.3.15f1.  See the README.md file in each folder for an explanation of the pattern it represents.

### /FlippidyTap
This is one such project that constituted a self-released ios and android game that I put out in 2018.  I've shared the animation and script files, tough the rest of the project has been kept private because, well hey, who gives away their IP's for free these days?

Of specific interest, I'd like to flag the FlippidyTap/Assets/Scripts/LocalizationFiles scripts, starting with LocalizationManager.  As a side goal for FlippidyTap I wanted to write a Localization manager that could, well, take a loc' jSON file and re-translate the game on the fly.  It worked fairly well by associating element names and types to an array of localized strings.  It was also the last thing I worked on in the project, so the code was more mature than some of the earlier elements.
