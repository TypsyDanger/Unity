# FlippidyTap
I had built and released FlippidyTap in May of 2018 as a side project in which I wanted to create (including all art) and release a game on iOS and Android on my own without any assistance.

I didn't intend to make money on this considering I had no marketing budget and didn't have the time to flaunt it.  The objectives for the game were as follow:

1. Create and release a game, solo
2. Create a localization manager that can support any number of languages
3. Make the game free-to-play with an unlockable premium mode using platform-specific IAP

I admit now that the code likely contains a lot of deprecations considering it was built in 2018, and I wasn't using namespaces at the time (which I would now).  There are likely a lot of other approaches used that were rudimentary back then which I would cringe at now, but I hope these scripts are useful to anyone who finds them.
