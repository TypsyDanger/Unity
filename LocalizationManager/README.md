# LocalizationManager
This was a set of scripts I created for FlippidyTap that handled Localization of images and text components. 

It had an accompanying jSON file that would get parsed in order to update images (by their ID's) and text field copy (by their names) using localizaed values for a given selected language.

In the future, I will add a test Unity project to show this in action, but for now, please use the files as reference.
